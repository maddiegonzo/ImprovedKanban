Project Overview:
Our project seeks to improve existing kanban tools by offering more customizability and productivity tools to enable teams to complete work more efficiently. Specifically, we have implemented a filtering feature to narrow down tasks to a ceertain user, a To-Do list, enabled deadlines on tasks, and allowed more customizability for column titles.
